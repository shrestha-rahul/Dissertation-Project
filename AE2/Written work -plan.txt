* Mock Ups
* The complete application-whats finished, whats not
* Project requirements
* Even though the machine learning is integrated, users are able explore through running streamlit

Methodology: ????
* How the application will be tested, 
* how the machine leaarning will be tested
* Ethics?

* Machine Learning
* Regresion Models, the 3 models, dataset, EDA,  training the models, results, which one did best
* Classifcation Model, technical indicators, target variable, , eda, training the modes, the results, whic h one did best,




Resuts
* I guess the completed app
